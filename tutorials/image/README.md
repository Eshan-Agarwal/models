# Tutorials for Image data and models

* This directory contains functions for creating Object detection and Image classification tasks using various popular methods. Detailed instructions on how to get started and use them are available in the tutorials on [tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).

* Here is a short overview of what is in this directory:

File         | What's in it?
------------ | -------------
`alexnet/`       | AlexNet inference model, see the [Transfer Learning Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning)
`cifar10/` | Builds the CIFAR-10 network, see the [CNN Tutorial for CIFAR](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn)
`cifar10_estimator/` | CIFAR-10 data set, see the [this](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
`imagenet/` | Simple image classification with Inception trained on ImageNet, see the [Transfer Learning with TF Hub](https://tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition/)
`mnist/` | Contains simple, end-to-end, LeNet-5-like convolutional MNIST model example, see the [MNIST data details](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/mnist/load_data)
